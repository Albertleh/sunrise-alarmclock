# sunrise-alarmclock

I don't feel like spending this much just to wake up:

An old desk lamp + Arduino, ... voila! 

Flash this script onto your Arduino and choose a pin that supports pwm. You can hook up leds that are then gonna be dimmed like a sunrise on a desired wake up time. Or what I also like is to take a beefier lightsource and use a mosfet to control high-amp lights to blow your face out of bed in the morning if you know you have a particulary hard time waking up.
