An old desk lamp + Arduino, ... voila! 

Flash this script onto your Arduino and choose a ledpin that supports pwm. You can hook up leds that are then gonna be dimmed like a sunrise on a desired wake up time. Or what I also like is to take a beefier lightsource and use a mosfet to control high-amp lights to blow your face out of bed in the morning if you know you have a particulary hard time waking up.
